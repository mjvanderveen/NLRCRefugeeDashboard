The current resources and action implemented by the different humanitarian actors in Baidoa are not sufficient to support vulnerable households with WASH facilities and services, while actually it is considered extremely recommended, in order to avoid the spreading of diseases and dramatic hygiene conditions among the target population as well as ensuring emergency response to the most urgent needs of urban and semiurban vulnerable households in crisis as well as children and women in target communities. In this regard, the activities proposed within the present action will complement and reinforce the GBV running program in the area. Moreover, to enable more efficient achievements and wider impact, the WASH intervention has been design as integral part of a broader INTERSOS planned intervention including Education and Shelter/NFIs specific activities through a multi-sectoral approach",

It also builds up on the recommendations of the prior projects as well as the final self-evaluation study carried out in first phase of project 2010. \n\nFemale genital mutilation/cutting (FGM), is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a range of procedures which involve �the partial or complete removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs whether for cultural or any other non-therapeutic reason�. Among the Somalis, the overwhelming majority (98%) of women is genitally mutilated when they are 6-9 years old. The negative physical and psychological implications of FGM on girls and concern over the violation of basic human rights makes FGM a matter of pressing concern. At the same time the above mentioned socio-cultural analysis shows clearly that there is widespread low awareness among the community about FGM.\n\nThe persistent and the deep-rooted nature of the practice require a long term commitment to fight against FGM. Therefore, CHLE/ISF project on �Support Community Education on FGM in Somaliland� is an extension of previous projects that CLHE and ISF have collaborated in their implementation (starting from 2007). This project will be part of a long process aimed at eventually leading to the abandonment of FGM practise and improved physical and psychological health of women in Togdheer and Sanaag regions. \n\nEnhancing community members� awareness about the negative consequences of FGM in Togdheer and Sanaag is a key element of increasing women�s reproductive health. It is envisaged that when more community members become aware of the negative consequences of FGM less girls will be forced to undergo FGM. The project will result into more community awareness about FGM, more community health workers becoming aware of its hazards and at the same time challenging FGM as a religious obligation. This will be reached through among the community, capacity building and establishment of networking mechanism with the different stakeholders and finally collaborate with Burao and Erigavo hospitals to deal females with related to FGM impacts. The project will also respond to crucial training needs of project staff so that they can be able to address the FGM issue in an efficient and effective manner.",

The current project enables these CBOs to increase and stabilize these incomes for their Community Development Funds through continued training and coaching from the PartnerAid training team. It enables these CBOs to further utilize these funds for community selected, owned, and managed health development projects and provides them with the training and coaching needed to manage and maintain these initiatives. \nIn addition, the project increases local water access by partnering with CBOs to reconstruct water cisterns. To maximize the benefit of funds contributed and to ensure community ownership, PartnerAid will contribute resources for the reconstruction of up to 8 berkads and up to 4 shallow wells, with the communities contributing at least 50% of the resources.

Utilizing a comprehensive multi-sectoral strategy, the proposed project aims to bring about improvements in three areas: an increase in income of extremely poor and most vulnerable individuals within both returnee and receiving populations, an increase in the sources of skilled labour from the community for the community, and an increase in access to basic services across diverse sector areas of support. \n\nThrough an innovative intensive skills-to-market approach, the present intervention will strengthen the livelihood asset base at the village level, combining basic literacy and classroom learning with practical hands-on, participatory learning in Cash For Work community-driven projects, directly boosting each target village�s capacity to provide basic services, such as infrastructure rehabilitation for both education and WASH, and community health and hygiene. The planned activities respond to migration challenges by increasing household income and food security levels. This is achieved by supporting the local market within the villages of return, expanding employment opportunities, community service projects and improving the diversity and quality of the skills-base of both returnees and receiving community members. Improved living and socio-economic conditions in the villages of origin contribute to a foundational level recovery strategy at this critical stage, building resilience and creating the basis to encourage future returns. Through the community-based participatory approach (CBPA), coping mechanisms will be improved at both the individual and community level, by linking the productive skills of the returnees to the needs of the community."
